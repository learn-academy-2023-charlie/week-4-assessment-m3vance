# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: 
OOP is is a programming language based around all data being objects. It is different from functional programming in the way it is approached. in OOP, we start by using objects to represent what we want abnd build around that, while in functional programming, we begin by creating functions or processes that we want to happen. 

Researched answer:
OOP uses mutable(changeable) data, while functional programming uses immutable data. In OOP, data is executed in order from top to bottom, while in functional programming, data can be executed in any order. The basic elements of OOP are objects and methods, while in functional programming, they are variables and functions.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?
